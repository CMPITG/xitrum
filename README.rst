Xitrum ("Smurf" in Vietnamese) is a lightweight Scala web framework and web
server on top of `Netty <http://www.jboss.org/netty>`_:

* It fills the gap between `Scalatra <https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra>`_
  and `Lift <http://liftweb.net/>`_: more powerful than Scalatra but less complex than Lift.
  You can easily define RESTful routes and postbacks.
* Typesafe, in the spirit of Scala.
* Asynchronous, in the spirit of Netty.
* Stateless, by default sessions are not stored on server.
* In-process and distribued cache using `Hazelcast <http://www.hazelcast.com/>`_,
  you don't need separate Memcache servers.
* Scalable `Comet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)>`_,
  you can scale Comet to multiple servers.

Xitrum is inspired by `Nitrogen <http://nitrogenproject.com/>`_.
