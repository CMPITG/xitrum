Xitrum ("Smurf" in Vietnamese) is a lightweight Scala web framework and web
server on top of Netty:

* It fills the gap between Scalatra and Lift:
  More powerful than Scalatra but less complex than Lift.
  You can easily define URL routings (Scalatra style) and POSTbacks (Lift style).
* Asynchronous, in the spirit of Netty.
* Type-safe, in the spirit of Scala.
* Stateless, by default session is stored in cookie.
