Xitrum (XT) is a super fast web server and framework on top of Netty:
* It fills the gap between Scalatra (Step) and Lift: it is more powerful than
  Scalatra and less complex than Lift
* It combines MVC (controller first) style and component-based (view first) style
* If you are familiar with Merb or Nitrogen, you will be at home with XT
* It does not try to abstract away from the underlying network layer, but lets
  you talk directly to Netty whenever you want, unlike most frameworks

Layers in XT are tightly coupled for speed.

== Project source directory layout

A typical blog application will have this directory layout:

lib
  jrebel.jar
lib_managed
project
public
  css
  img
  js
src
  main
    scala
      myapp
        controller
          Articles.scala
        helper
          ArticleHelper.scala
        model
          Article.scala
          Schema.scala
    resources
      myapp
        view
          articles
            index.scaml
            show.scala
      c3p0.properties
  migrate
    schema1.sql
    schema2.sql
tmp
  scalate

== Project deployed directory layout

bin
lib
  myapp.jar
public
tmp
  scalate
