Connection pool using c3p0 is included.

You must manually add driver for your specific DB.

For example, for PostgreSQL or MySQL, add to your SBT project definition
something like:

override def libraryDependencies =
  Set(
    "postgresql" % "postgresql"           % "8.4-701.jdbc4" % "compile->default",
    //"mysql"      % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.13"        % "compile->default"
  ) ++ super.libraryDependencies

For Oracle, you must download the driver manualy:
