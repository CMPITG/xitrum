Xitrum is a super fast web server and framework on top of Netty:
* It fills the gap between Scalatra and Lift: it is more powerful than
  Scalatra and less complex than Lift
* It combines MVC (controller first) style and component-based (view first) style
* If you are familiar with Merb or Nitrogen, you will be at home with Xitrum
* It does not try to abstract away from the underlying network layer, it lets
  you talk directly to Netty whenever you want, unlike most frameworks

Layers in Xitrum are tightly coupled for speed.

Xitrum needs Java 5 or above because of Netty.

== SBT project layout

A typical blog application will have this directory layout:

config
  blog.properties
  logback.properties
lib
  jrebel.jar
lib_managed
project
public
  css
  img
  js
src
  main
    scala
      blog
        controller
          ArticleController.scala
        helper
          ArticleHelper.scala
        model
          Article.scala

== SBT project dependency

To add Xitrum to project dependencies:
"tv.cntt" %% "xitrum" % "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

Xitrum uses SLF4J 1.6.1. You must provide an SLF4J implentation that compatible
with SLF4J 1.6.1, like logback-classic 0.9.27:
"ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "0.9.27"

== Project deployed directory layout

bin
  runner.sh
config
  blog.properties
  logback.properties
lib
  blog.jar
  ...
public
  css
  img
  js
