Xitrum is a super fast web server and framework on top of Netty:
* It fills the gap between Scalatra and Lift: it is more powerful than
  Scalatra and less complex than Lift
* It combines MVC (controller first) style and component-based (view first) style
* If you are familiar with Merb or Nitrogen, you will be at home with Xitrum
* It does not try to abstract away from the underlying network layer, it lets
  you talk directly to Netty whenever you want, unlike most frameworks

Layers in Xitrum are tightly coupled for speed.

Xitrum needs Java 5 or above because of Netty.

== SBT project layout

A typical blog application will have this directory layout:

config
  blog.properties
  log4j.properties
lib
  jrebel.jar
lib_managed
project
public
  css
  img
  js
src
  main
    scala
      blog
        controller
          Articles.scala
        helper
          ArticleHelper.scala
        model
          Article.scala
    resources
      blog
        view
          articles
            index.scaml
            show.scaml
tmp
  scalate

To add only xitrum to project dependencies:
"tv.cntt" %% "xitrum" % "1.0-SNAPSHOT" % "compile"

== Project deployed directory layout

bin
  xitrum.sh
config
  blog.properties
  log4j.properties
lib
  blog.jar
public
  css
  img
  js
tmp
  scalate
