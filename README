Xitrum is Scala web framework and server on top of Netty:
* It fills the gap between Scalatra and Lift:
  More powerful than Scalatra but less complex than Lift.
* It combines MVC (controller first) style and component (view first) style.
  If you are familiar with Rails or Nitrogen, you will be at home with Xitrum.
* Asynchronous, in the spirit of Netty.
* Type-safe, in the spirit of Scala.
* Stateless, by default sessions are saved in cookie. You can easily run
  multiple instances of your web application behind a firewall. This is a huge
  win over servlet.
* It does not try to abstract away from the underlying network layer, it lets
  you talk directly to Netty whenever you want.

Layers in Xitrum are tightly coupled for speed.

Xitrum needs Java 5 or above because of Netty.

== SBT project source directory layout

A typical blog application will have this directory layout:

config
  blog.properties
  logback.properties
lib
  jrebel.jar
lib_managed
project
public
  upload
src
  main
    scala
      blog
        action
          ArticleIndex.scala
          ArticleShow.scala
          ArticleNewEdit.scala
        helper
          ArticleHelper.scala
        model
          Article.scala
    resources
      public
        blog
          css
          img
          js

== SBT project dependency

To add Xitrum to project dependencies:
"tv.cntt" %% "xitrum" % "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

Xitrum uses SLF4J 1.6.1. You must provide an SLF4J implentation that compatible
with SLF4J 1.6.1, like logback-classic 0.9.27:
"ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "0.9.27"

== Deployed directory layout

bin
  runner.sh               <-- Script to start the web server
config                    <-- Config files are outside .jar files, edit any time you want
  blog.properties             They are put in classpath by runner.sh
  logback.properties
  xitrum.properties
lib
  blog.jar                <-- css/img/js are concrete thus packaged here
  ...
public
  upload                  <-- Directory to store user uploaded files
