Xitrum (XT) is a super fast web server and framework on top of Netty:
* It fills the gap between Scalatra (Step) and Lift: it is more powerful than
  Scalatra and less complex than Lift
* It combines MVC (controller first) style and component-based (view first) style
* If you are familiar with Merb or Nitrogen, you will be at home with XT
* It does not try to abstract away from the underlying network layer, but lets
  you talk directly to Netty whenever you want, unlike most frameworks
