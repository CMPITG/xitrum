Notes for Xitrum developers.

Delete snapshots
----------------

While developing, you may need to publish and delete published snapshots.

To publish, run ``sbt`` then from SBT command prompt run ``+ publish``.

To delete snapshots:

::

  $ find ~/.ivy2 -name *xitrum* -delete

Netty 4
-------

**This part will be removed when Netty 4 is officially released.**

File upload feature in Xitrum needs `Netty <https://github.com/netty/netty>`_ 4,
which has not been released.

You can use `nightly builds <http://www.jboss.org/netty/downloads.html`_
instead of `building it yourself <http://www.jboss.org/netty/build>`_.
